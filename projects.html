        Our video game is a Horror 2D Roguelike where the player is constantly challenged. Various monsters lurk within the shadows, and once they have their eyes set on the player, survival becomes a matter of escape or die trying. What sets our game apart is how the AI Monsters are built. Their reactions are based on sight and sound. Each monster has a unique way of interacting with the player.
        Each level is procedurally generated. While traversing levels, the player must gather items to help them fight back or escape, avoid dangerous enemies, and collect scattered teleporter parts to win the game. With the core philosophy of a roguelike, players must accept that death is not the end. Every failure reveals new information that can improve their runs. Ranging from learning how monsters behave, how items function, and what lies within the darkness. The gameplay loop rewards caution, curiosity, and cleverness.
        To bring this experience to life, we pushed Unity to its limits. With the creation of a custom lighting solution and integration of third-party tools, we built an experience of true despair. One that players will feel once they descend into the Lurking Abyss.

    <h3>Item System</h3>
    <p>
        Designed a reusable item system with limited charges to encourage
        strategic decision making and prevent overpowered item usage.
    </p>

    <h3>Player Controller</h3>
    <p>
        Implemented the complete player controller, including responsive movement,
        damage handling, and a Invincible mechanic with invulnerability frames to support
        skill-based and reactive gameplay.
    </p>

    <h3>Enemies</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Mimic:</strong> Disguises itself as an item and triggers on interaction to damage player then quickly hide to transform again.</li>
        <li><strong>Scavenger:</strong> A mechanical reflection of the player’s abilities. Depending on player interaction, the Scavenger will respond differently.</li>
    </ul>

            This game was developed for the Pirate Software Game Jam 16. The theme was "You Are The Weapon". So within our game,
            the player controls a character who can defeat and steal enemy attacks to use against others. The player spawns into a level with
            a set number of enemies. The goal is to defeat all the enemies and gain the chosen reward at the end. This can range from new attacks, stat increases,
            or gold. When the players has a set amount of gold, they can pay for their freedom. Thus winning the game.
