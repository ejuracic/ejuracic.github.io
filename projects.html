    <p>
        Our video game is a Horror 2D Roguelike where the player is constantly challenged. Various monsters lurk within the shadows, and once they have their eyes set on the player, survival becomes a matter of escape or die trying. What sets our game apart is how the AI Monsters are built. Their reactions are based on sight and sound. Each monster has a unique way of interacting with the player.
        Each level is procedurally generated. While traversing levels, the player must gather items to help them fight back or escape, avoid dangerous enemies, and collect scattered teleporter parts to win the game. With the core philosophy of a roguelike, players must accept that death is not the end. Every failure reveals new information that can improve their runs. Ranging from learning how monsters behave, how items function, and what lies within the darkness. The gameplay loop rewards caution, curiosity, and cleverness.
        To bring this experience to life, we pushed Unity to its limits. With the creation of a custom lighting solution and integration of third-party tools, we built an experience of true despair. One that players will feel once they descend into the Lurking Abyss.

    <h3>Item System</h3>
    <p>
      Designed a reusable item system with limited charges to encourage strategic decision making and prevent overpowered item usage, including items for Combat, Movement, and Environment that each provide unique tactical advantages.

    <h3>Player Controller</h3>
    <p>
      Implemented the full player system, including eight-direction movement, sneaking, dodging, and object interactions. Built a strategic equipment system with limited-charge items, allowing the player to select and use abilities while emphasizing tactical decision-making.
    </p>

    <h3>Enemies</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Mimic:</strong> A monster that disguises itself as any interactable items. It attacks any creature that interacts with it, including the player and Scavenger, and relocates when detected until it is safe to transform again.</li>
        <li><strong>Scavenger:</strong> A mostly passive monster reflecting the player that collects items it encounters and avoids combat unless provoked. It reacts intelligently to threats, using items or escaping when necessary, and dynamically responds to both the player’s actions and the presence of hunter-type monsters.</li>
    </ul>

            This game was developed for the Pirate Software Game Jam 16. The theme was "You Are The Weapon".
            Amino is a pixel tile turn-based combat game where players take contracts, enter enemy-filled levels, and hunt down foes using a mix of permanent and temporary attacks. Defeating enemies grants temporary abilities, and players can chain different attack patterns for maximum effect.

        <h3>Turn Based System</h3>
        <p>
          Developed a flexible turn-based system coordinating both player actions and enemy AI behaviors. Players can move and chain attacks strategically, while enemies react dynamically based on range and positioning, creating engaging and tactical combat scenarios.
